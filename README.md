# Finecreations Wordpress Theme

Basic Wordpress theme built from scratch using Bootstrap as a framework and Wordpress 3.9. I use this theme on my site and wanted to provide it to anyone who's interested in using it for their site or as a starting point. The theme was primarily built as a minimal portfolio website. I'll continue to add features to theme to as time allows.

Please feel free to fork the repo and flag any bugs, suggest features, etc. I'm also happy to check out any pull requests. 

Please note: My site is using a different font than provided in the assets in the repo. The font is called Bariol and is a paid font. If you would like to purchase the font, it can be bought for 1 Euro (aboout $4 when I bought it) here <a href="http://www.bariol.com/">Bariol Font</a>. You can also get the Bariol Regular font by paying with a tweet from the same website. I've provided Varela Rounded which is free on Google Webfonts as an alternative. To use Varela rounded, you will need to adjust the custom.css file to replace the font.
